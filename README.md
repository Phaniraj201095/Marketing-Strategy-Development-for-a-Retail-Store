# Marketing-Strategy-Development-for-a-Retail-Store

Data analysis of sold goods and customers information is an eﬀective marketing strategy for retail stores to increase sales amount. In this project, we select a database of retail store as the object, including the amount of purchase of diﬀerent types of goods, as well as  the  information  of customers' gender, age, city, occupation, marital status and so on. We use Python and Excel as data processing tools. The main data analysis steps are data acquisition, data cleaning, data visualization and data modelling. This report shows the process and results of data analysis, including the code of python and data distribution image. From the above analysis, we get some conclusions on how to develop this retail store’s sales amount.
